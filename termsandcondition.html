        feature enables these individuals to view specific transactions without

        assists in the secure management of finances, particularly in a business
        context.

        and analyze transactions by trip or shift. This capability is
        particularly useful for businesses and individuals who require detailed
        tracking of expenses on a per-shift basis. By leveraging batch tracking,
        users can gain deeper insights into their spending patterns and make
        informed financial decisions.
