      <p>
        Welcome to StreetPay! By accessing or using our services, you agree to
        the following terms and conditions. Please read them carefully.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        StreetPay is a revolutionary finance app for easy personal and business
        use. Our platform allows users to connect with vendors, manage expenses,
        and gain insights on financial transactions through secure and
        user-friendly features.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Using StreetPay</h2>
      <p>
        StreetPay provides various features such as "Handshake" and "Nearby,"
        which enable users to connect with vendors without the need to share
        account numbers. You may also pin key contacts to review bills, share
        expenses, and streamline transactions.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Guest Access</h2>
      <p>
        StreetPay allows trusted cashiers or team members limited access to view
        transactions through Guest Access. This feature provides transparency
        and helps with secure management of finances within a business setting.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Batch Tracking</h2>
      <p>
        With batch tracking, StreetPay offers insights on transactions by trip
        or shift. This feature is ideal for users needing to track expenses on a
        per-shift basis, making it a flexible tool for both personal and
        business financial management.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Security and Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        We are committed to protecting your information. All transactions and
        data shared on StreetPay are encrypted to ensure privacy and security.
        Users are encouraged to manage access carefully to maintain the
        integrity of their financial data.
